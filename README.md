# SOCIALgrAMM

### This application is basically a replica of Instragram. You can login and logout from your accounts. Upload a picture. Also you can see your friends post ans like them using a thumb button.

#### This project I made to learn and dive into the world of Ruby on Rails. I enjoyed every bit of making it.
